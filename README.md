This repository contains a collection of programming projects completed during my freshman year as a Computer Science major. These assignments were created to build foundational skills in Python, problem-solving, and software development practices.

Each folder or file represents a separate project or exercise, ranging from basic scripting to small applications demonstrating core CS concepts.

Skills Demonstrated
	•	Python fundamentals
	•	Problem solving & algorithmic thinking
	•	Input validation
	•	Arithmetic and logical operations
	•	Structuring small, modular programs
